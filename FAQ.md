# FAQ

## How many photos can I post?

We know you could type lots of text, or copy from the downloaded material, but we'll just fake some text.

Not typing as much as we might.

A third paragraph with maybe one sentence? We should have two! Or three since the actual material we should be typing is made up of a few sentences.

## Where do I list my favorite treats?

Open the Hawt Dawg app.

Scroll down. Do some stuff.

You're done when you click Save Changes!

## Photos are nice and all, but I don't see very well. How can I smell the other dogs?

We regret no.

As soon as tech allow, we'll update

In the meantime, go to the dog park.
